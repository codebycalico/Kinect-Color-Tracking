# Kinect Color Tracking
 Using the Kinect V2 as a camera to track specific colors.
 
 Program starts as white as the default, but the user can click on a specific color on the screen and it will track that color.
 
 It finds all of those color instances and averages the point in between them to draw the ellipse. Using the threshold variable, the user can adjust how intense they want the color tracking to be, how acute to that specific color. For projects with many variations of similar colors, only wanting to track one of those colors, a smaller threshold will help the camera (Kinect) detect the specific object wanting to be tracked.
